# Early Detection Of Chronic Kidney Disease Using Machine LearningÂ 
##  Category: 
#### Machine Learning
## Skills Required:
Machine Learning, Python, Python Web Frame Works, Python for Data Visualization, Data Preprocessing Methods, Machine Learning, IBM Cloud, IBM Watson Studio, and Python-Flask are necessities.
## Project Description:
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a serious medical condition that, if caught early enough, is curable. Most individuals are unaware that the various medical tests we undergo for various reasons may provide important information about kidney disorders. As a result, characteristics of numerous medical tests are examined to see which characteristics might contain useful information about the disease. According to the information, it enables us to assess the problem's seriousness and we use this data to create a machine learning model that forecasts chronic kidney disease.
